 A Garry's Mod Addon focused on implementing the NPC's and their features from the Halo CE mod, "SPV3" into Garry's Mod. Originally created by Mayhem.
 
 Changes from workshop version can be found further down.

# Installation
The best way to keep an up-to-date version with me would be to use Github desktop or another version of fetching clones. To install using Github Desktop, check the instructions in this link: https://giant.gfycat.com/ColossalIdealisticAlbino.webm

After you have a clone, anytime an update occurs, you just have to click "Pull Origin" (Click "Fetch Origin" first if that button isn't there)

 Alternatively, if you wish to install the addon manually, simply click "Code" and then "Download Zip"

After that, take the folder inside the zip and put it in your "Addons" folder in your garrys mod folder.
